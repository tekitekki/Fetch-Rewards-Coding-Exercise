# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise

I worked with 3 unstructured JSON data files and developed a new structured relational data model as shown in the ER diagram. Then I leveraged Python to do exploratory data analysis and capture data quality issues. After that, I wrote MySQL queries to answer some business questions from a business stakeholder. At last, I drafted a short email to the business stakeholder to discuss my findings and concerns.
